// Some useful macros and constants used in various places in the code

// Random float from 0.0 to 1.0
#define RANDOM_FLOAT_01 ((float)(random() % 100) / 100.0)
// Random float from -1.0 to 1.0
#define RANDOM_FLOAT_11 ((float)(random() % 200) / 100.0 - 1.0)
/// Assorted constants

// Near and far clipping planes, cm from the user's eye
#define CLIP_NEAR 40.0
#define CLIP_FAR 250.0

// Field of view in degrees
#define FIELD_OF_VIEW 45.0
// Needed for correct calculation of fov
#define PI 3.1415926535897932384626433832795
// Tangent of half that value, used for calculating coordinate ranges
#define TAN_FOV 0.4142

// Integer number of glyphs in the texture pixmap
// The pixmap is an 8x8 grid, glyph 0 = top left, and should be empty space
// Each square of the grid is 32x32 and contains one glyph
// Not all squares need to be filled
#define NUM_GLYPHS 64

// Cell size in cm
// Bear in mind that it needs to be visible when CLIP_FAR away, each cell holds one glyph
#define CELL_SIZE 1.0

// Cell spacing in strips is multiplied by this, to pull them apart a bit
#define QUAD_SQUISH_FACTOR 1.02
